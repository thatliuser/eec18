# EEC 18
This repository contains all the schematic and Verilog files I used to complete my labs in UC Davis's EEC 18 course.

## [Lab 1](1/1.pdf)
Introduction: using counter and display ICs to get used to using Quartus schematics.

## [Lab 2](2/2.pdf)
Using K-maps to find the functions for a custom 7-segment display sequence.

## [Lab 3](3/3.pdf)
Using a multiplexer and building ICs to create a counter that counts up to 16.

## [Lab 4](4/4.pdf)
Sequential logic exploration: latches, flip-flops, and registers.

## [Lab 5](5/5.pdf)
Finite state machines: creating a dice roller.

## [Lab 6](6/6.pdf)
Dice roll game. Player rolls a number and decides whether or not to keep it.
6v directory contains SystemVerilog prototype I used before finalizing the schematic version.
